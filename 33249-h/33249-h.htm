001. In this album, there are no monuments described in all touristic
guides. On the contrary, these twelve Romanesque churches are little
known. They are located in Southern Manche, that is to say in the
southern part of the department of Manche, in Normandy, along the coast
or in the countryside. These churches were built in the 10th, 11th and
12th century by villagers and parishioners, with local stones - schist
and granite - on the medieval roads used by pilgrims to reach Mont
Saint-Michel, their final destination after travelling for many months.

003. Southern Manche. An old map of the region. This region has
belonged to Cotentin for its northern part and Avranchin for its
southern part. The limit between Cotentin and Avranchin is the small
river Thar, that flows into the Channel at the south of Granville. In
the Middle Ages, this region was rich, with more people living on the
coast than inside the land. The economic life was active, with
fisheries, salines near Saint-Martin-de-Bréhal, Bréville and
Saint-Léonard-de-Vains, pitch sand and kelp used as fertilizers, and a
number of intensive cultures. This old map belongs to the collection of
the city library in Granville. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-02]

Saint-Martin-le-Vieux, Bréville, Yquelon and Saint-Pair-sur-Mer were
part of the deanery of Saint-Pair, one of the five deaneries of the
archidiachoné of Coutances. The archidiachoné of Coutances was one of
the four archidiachonés of the diocese of Coutances, the other ones
being the archidiachonés of Cotentin, Bauptois and Val-de-Vire. Map by

Sartilly, Saint-Jean-le-Thomas, Dragey and Genêts were part of the
deanery of Genêts and the archidiachoné of Avranches, like the priory
of Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. The archidiachoné of Avranches included
three other deaneries: the deanery of Avranches, the deanery of
Tirepied (that included the parish of Saint-Loup) and the deanery of
the Chrétienté (Christendom). The deanery of the Chrétienté included
nine parishes around the episcopal town of Avranches, including the
parish of Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. Map by Marie Lebert.

006. Southern Manche. The medieval roads going to Mont Saint-Michel.
This region was crossed by several roads used by pilgrims to reach Mont
Saint-Michel. At the north of Avranches, we had from west to east the
shore road coming from Saint-Pair-sur-Mer, the road coming from
Saint-Pair-sur-Mer (with a different route), the road coming from
Coutances, the road coming from Saint-Lô, and the road coming from
Caen. At the south of Avranches, a medieval road was used by the
pilgrims coming from Tinchebray, Condé-sur-Noireau, Falaise or Lisieux
to reach Mont Saint-Michel. Map by Marie Lebert.

007. Southern Manche. Geological map. All these churches were built in
granite and schist, which were the local stones. Sedimentary grounds
formed by schist rocks surround two large granite grounds, those of
Vire and Avranches. Laying down from east to west, the granite ground
of Vire is around five kilometers large, and ends on the west with the
cliffs of Carolles and Champeaux. Laying down from west to east, the
granite ground of Avranches is narrower, and only from two to four
kilometers large. These granite grounds are both surrounded by a
metamorphic ring formed with  schist rocks and grauwack (a kind of
schist) rocks. The ground of Saint-Pair is a flysch (detritic ground)
formed with grauwack rocks, siltit rocks et black argilit rocks with
some schist inside. The ground of Granville is a flysch formed with
grauwack rocks alternating with schist rocks. Map by Marie Lebert.

Saint-Martin-le-Vieux is located between Bréhal and the sea, near the
haven of the Venlée, 2 kilometers west of Bréhal and 9 kilometers north
of Granville. The village was situated on the medieval road coming from
Cherbourg and going to Saint-Pair-sur-Mer to reach Mont Saint-Michel,
the final destination for many pilgrims.

009. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The church, in ruins, stands on a hill. The
church was under St Martin's patronage, and the second saint was St.
Eutropius. The parish belonged to the deanery of St-Pair and the
archidiachoné of Coutances. Foulques Paynel, probably a relative of
Guillaume Paynel, founder of the Abbey of Hambye in 1145, gave to the
abbey part of the tithe of the parish of Saint-Martin-le-Vieux, a
donation mentioned in the cartulary of the Abbey of Hambye. During the
French Revolution, the church was used as an arsenal and all its
furniture was sold. It became a church again in 1801 but, as it was
threatening to collapse around 1804 or 1805, it was no longer used.
Since that time, the parish of Saint-Martin-le-Vieux is part of the
parish of Bréhal. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-01]

010. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The Romanesque ruins, with a double belfry
added in the 16th century. The ruins were overgrown by vegetation for a
while. The masonry is made of irregular blocks in schist and granite.
The arches and abutments of the openings are in granite. The schist is
the local stone. The granit could come from the granite ground of Vire
a few miles south. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-002]

walls is made of irregular blocks of schist and granite. Elements of
opus spicatum (fishbone masonry) are visible, a proof the south wall is
the oldest part of the church. Above the door, the little trefoil bay
was probably added in the 16th century, during the building of the
belfry. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-005]

019. Bréville. The Romanesque church among the trees. In the 12th
century, Bréville had an active economic life, with fisheries, salines,
pitch sand and kelp used as fertilizers, and intensive crops. The
territory of the parish was owned by Mont Saint-Michel since 1022, when
Richard II, duke of Normandy, gave the barony of Saint-Pair to Mont
Saint-Michel. In the 13th century, the patronage was secular, with
Guillelmus de Breinville as the lord between 1251 and 1279. The tithe
was shared between the pastor and the abbot of Mont Saint-Michel. In
the 16th century, Bréville, with its church and salines, was a prebend
for the cathedral of Coutances. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-006]

walls of the choir are Romanesque, and probably from the second half of
the 12th century. The masonry is made of irregular blocks of schist.
Granite is used for the buttresses, the abutments of openings, the
attached piers, the columns and the arches. Photo by Claude Rayon.

part of the barony of Saint-Pair, owned by Mont Saint-Michel since
1022, when Richard II, duke of Normandy, gave the barony to the Mont.
The lord of Yquelon, Rogerius de Ikelun, affixed his signature to two
main charters of the Abbey of the Lucerne in 1162. In the 13th century,
the patronage was certainly secular. The tithe was shared between the
pastor, who was receiving most of it, the Abbey of Montmorel (located
in Poilley, near Ducey), and the leper hospital Saint-Blaise de
Champeaux. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-023]

chamfer is also adorned with a row of slightly visible saw-teeth. The
inner grain rests on two attached columns through capitals. Their
basket, topped by a square abacus, is adorned with small angle hooks.
The door certainly underwent an overhaul: both capitals, without an
astragalus, are not well connected to the shaft of the columns and to
the beginning of the arch, the torus of which is cut. The outer grain

059. Yquelon. The enfeu and its tombstone. In the north wall of the
nave, an enfeu (recess for a tombstone) with a lowered centering houses
a 12th-century tombstone in soft limestone depicting a knight. Mr Lomas
described it in a journal named Bulletin of the Society of Antiquaries
in Normandy (Bulletin de la Société des Antiquaires de Normandie) dated
1886-1887: "The tombstone bears a knight in relief, depicted with his
hands clasped, his head resting on a pillow, and his greyhound at his
feet. (...) It bears no indication of his name or no indication of a
year. It is therefore impossible to specify the person whose remains
are covered. What we can say with certainty is that this person belongs
to the powerful family of Yquelon, whose family member Roger Yquelon
affixed his signature on two main charters of the Abbey of the Lucerne
in 1162." Discovered in 1885 in the cemetery adjoining the north of the
church, the tombstone was embedded in the enfeu in February 1893. At
the length of the enfeu, 2.15 meters, is exactly the length of the
tombstone, we can guess the tombstone was probably buried in the
cemetery at the time of the French Revolution, before being discovered
in 1885 and regaining its original location. Photo by Claude Rayon.

060. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. Location. The village of Saint-Pair-sur-Mer is
located on the coast, 3.5 kilometers south of Granville.
Saint-Pair-sur-Mer was a prosperous town and the vital center of the
region until the construction of Granville in the 15th century. Many
people moved to Granville then, at the expense of Saint-Pair.
Saint-Pair grew again in 1880 with the development of seaside resorts.
Medieval roads &mdash; a coast road and a shore road - were used by pilgrims
from Saint-Pair to Mont Saint-Michel, and are still used today by
"modern" pilgrims and visitors.

the second saint is St. Gaud. The church is a place of pilgrimage
dedicated to the worship of St. Gaud, whose sarcophagus was found in
1131 during the building of the Romanesque church. Much later, in 1880,
the Romanesque nave was demolished to be replaced by a much larger nave
and a transept to accommodate the many parishioners of this popular
seaside resort. The enlarged church was consecrated on August 26, 1888.

065. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. The plan of the present church. Regulary
oriented from west to east, the building has a two-row nave with a
porch, a large transept and a three-row choir with a semi-circular
apse. The external length of the whole building is 57,1 meters. The
external width of the nave is 11,1 meters. The square tower rises at
the crossing of the transept. The transept arms are opened by two apses
on their eastern side. The choir opens north on two chapels, one
towards the apse and one towards the tower. At the angle formed by the
south transept arm and the choir, a rectangular building houses the
sacristy. Plan by Marie Lebert.

066. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. The Romanesque tower. We can accurately give a
date to the tower foundations, which is very seldom. We know that they
date from 1131, thanks to a contemporary manuscript mentioning the
discovery of St. Gaud's sarcophagus in the choir during the digging of
the foundations. The same manuscript gives the name of the architect &mdash;
Rogerius Altomansiunculo - who supervised the works. To know an
architect's name is quite unusual too, because most architects of the
time were remaining anonymous. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-19]

abbot F. Baudry found part of the foundations of the 6th-century
oratory and several shell limestone sarcophagi: the sarcophagi of St.
Pair and St. Scubilion and, nearby, those of St. Senier and St.
Aroaste. St. Gaud's sarcophagus was found in 1131 while digging the
foundations of the Romanesque tower. This plan is included in the book
of Chanoine Pigeon entitled "Vie des Saints du Diocèse de Coutances et
d'Avranches" (Life of the Saints in the Diocese of Coutances and
Avranches), published in Avranches in 1888.

of the second row of the present choir, the double line of black tiles
surrounded by a row of clear tiles shows the exact place of the
foundations of the old oratory. The underneath foundations form a
semi-circular apse going on as side walls that disappear in the
Romanesque building. Fortunatus (530-600), bishop of Poitiers, wrote
in his "Vie de Saint Pair" (St. Pair's Life) that the cells of the
early monks were built beside the sea. Then monks move their dwellings
on the banks of the river Saigue, at the site of the present church,
attracting a population that settled around the oratory. In the
foreground, a white gravestone shows the spot where St. Pair's
sarcophagus was buried and discovered. Photo by Alain Dermigny.

probably from the 11th century and early 12th century. In the front
wall in the background, the two Romanesque bays were reopened in 1973
after being found under the plaster. The upper bay - a median bay
situated in the gable wall - was walled up at the same time, but its
granite abutments remain clearly visible. The barrel vault of the nave
is in plaster. The floor is covered with large pavings In granite.

101. Saint-Jean-le-Thomas. The Romanesque nave (inside). Romanesque
murals were found on the south wall of the nave, a very interesting
discovery because murals are almost non-existent in the region. The
existence of such ancient wall paintings, probably from the  12th
century, was unknown until 1974, until the plaster of the walls of the
nave was redone. Colour spots attracted the attention of abbot Porée,
pastor of the church, who then requested the visit of the fresco
specialists of the (French) Fine Arts Department. Photo by Alain

coastal road going from Granville to Avranches, 20 kilometers south of
Granville and 13 kilometers north of Avranches. Dragey was on the route
of three medieval roads, the first one coming from Saint-Pair-sur-Mer,
the second one coming from Coutances and the third one coming from
Saint-Lô. The shore road coming from Saint-Pair was crossing the dunes
of Dragey before reaching Mont Saint-Michel, the final destination for
many pilgrims.

133. Genêts. Location. The village of Genêts is located on the current
coastal road between Granville and Avranches, 6 kilometers north of
Avranches. The village is facing Mont Saint-Michel, around 4 kilometers
far away. The medieval roads used by pilgrims to go to Mont
Saint-Michel started from Saint-Pair-sur-Mer, Coutances, Saint-Lô and
Caen to reach Genêts. Then they needed to cross dangerous shores to
reach Mont Saint-Michel, their final destination. In addition, the
shore road between Saint-Pair and Mont Saint-Michel was crossing Bec
d'Andaine, near Genêts.

134. Genêts. The village and its church. The church tower - with its
saddleback roof, its balustrade and its gargoyles - emerges above the
roofs of the village. Genêts is a very old place. It was the tidal port
of Avranches, the capital of the region before its  looting by the
Norman pirates in the 9th century. The barony of Genêts was given in
1022 to the Abbey of Mont Saint-Michel by Richard II, duke of Normandy,
as well as the baronies of Saint-Pair and Ardevon. The center of a
barony and a deanery, Genêts became an active town under the early
Norman dukes. In the early 14th century, there were nearly 3,000
inhabitants, and the church counted seven chapels  and a full clergy.
This was the most flourishing period. During the Hundred Years War,
Genêts was looted, fleeced and burned by the British troops from 1356
on. During the Religion Wars between Catholics and Protestants, Genêts
was again sacked in 1562 by the troops of the Protestant Montgomery.
During the French Revolution, Genêts lost its juridiction of a
seneschal, its sergentery, its deanery, its fairs and its markets, and
went from being a town to being a village. The county town became
Sartilly. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-083]

on the site of an older timeworn church. The Romanesque church was
consecrated in 1157 by Herbert, bishop of Avranches, along with Roger,
abbot of Bec-Hellouin. The church and cemetery of Genêts were granted
the title of (French) Historic Monument in 1959. Photo by Claude Rayon.

the town of Avranches. The priory church stands in front of the bay of
Mont Saint-Michel and the rock of Tombelaine. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains
was the final village of the medieval road coming from Caen. Then the
pilgrims needed to cross the dangerous shores to reach Mont
Saint-Michel, their final destination. The priory church has become a
private property since the French Revolution, and the village is now
part of the parish of Vains.

158. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. Spring panorama taken from inside the
priory. From there, the Mont Saint-Michel seems to open itself to
pilgrims and travellers. Saint-Léonard is a very old village. St.
Leonard lived there in the 6th century before being elected the eighth
bishop of Avranches in 578. The village was then invaded by the Normans
in the 9th century. After the Norman conquest, the village was part of
the duke of Normandy's territory, and the fief of the lords of Vains.
In 1087, shortly before his death, William the Conqueror gave the
priory to the Abbey of Saint-Etienne in Caen. In 1158, Henry II
confirmed this donation, which included a mansion, arable lands and
vineyards, as well as salines with the right to fish and to collect
kelp. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-47]

monastery where some religious men detached from a main abbey were
living under the direction of a prior, but without taking care of other
souls (unlike a pastor for his parishoniers). The priory church was the

160. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. The priory was sold in 1793, during the
French Revolution, and the buyer turned the church into a farm
building. In an article from the periodical Le Pays de Granville dated
December 1976, Jean Bindet recounted that, "after the nationalization
of the church properties in November 1789 and the sale of national
properties from 1791 on, the priory and dovecote were left abandoned,
and their ruins, with the church that had not suffered too much, were
sold in 1793 for the sum of 200 francs in banknotes ... The buyer,
wanting its purchase to fructify, decided to transform the church into
a farm building. The choir of the ancient church became a kitchen with
a fireplace built in the apse; the nave became a barn and a stable; the
tower itself was used: the base as a cellar, and the floor was divided
into a room and an attic, and topped with a chimney." The priory
remained a farm for a long time, as evidenced by the cow behind the
fence. This old photo was digitized by Claude Rayon. [Claude-48]

with the (French) Historic Monuments, the owner has turned the nave
into a house by opening rectangular windows and revamping the interior.
In 1985, date of this photo, the tower and the choir are still in bad
shape. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-086]

162. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. The priory church. The nave has become the
owner's house in the late 20th century, which explains the rectangular
doors and windows. The building has retained its original form though,
with a nave strengthened by buttresses and a two-row choir with a flat
apse. The tower, between choir and nave, is topped by a saddleback
roof. In 1985, the tower and the choir have not been restored yet.

remaining in the region. Built by the lords of Saint-Loup, the church
was under St. Loup's patronage. The second saint is St. Gilles. The
parish belonged to the deanery of Tirepied and the archidiachoné of
Avranches. The nave has three rows. The north and south walls are
strenghtened by four buttresses on each side. Three small semi-circular
bays are still visible, two in the south wall and one in the north

listel, a shallow cavetto and a row of carved hollow saw-teeth. The
grains rest on four attached columns. Molded in quarter-round, the
capital abaci go on as an horizontal band along the wall. The baskets
are carved with rough sculptures: angle hooks or angle heads whose
features were erased with the test of time. The square bases are
adorned with a torus topping a chamfer carved with barely visible small
claws. They rest on a small stone wall going on along the whole length

situated on the medieval road taken by pilgrims from Tinchebray,
Condé-sur-Noireau, Falaise or Lisieux to reach Mont Saint-Michael. The
parish of Saint-Quentin was one of the nine parishes around the
episcopal church of Avranches, grouped in the deanery of Chrétienté

193. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. The large church has a rectangular
narthex (wide porch) along the entire length of the front. The base of
the tower and the nave are Romanesque - probably from the second half
of the 12th century - and have similarities with the church of
Saint-Loup. Several parts are from the 13th century: the narthex before
the church front, the two floors of the tower, the three-row choir, and
finally the south side chapel of the choir. The north side chapel was
built later on, in the 15th or 16th century. The walls of the nave
still bear the mark of the large bays that were opened in the 18th
century to replace the small Romanesque bays. The present bays date
from 1951, with a size similar to the original bays. Photo by Alain

194. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. The church plan. Regularly oriented
from west to east, the building is formed of a three-row nave and a
three-row choir with a flat apse. The whole building has an external
length of 47 meters and an external width of 9.6 meters (width of the
front). North and south, two large chapels are adjacent to the first
two rows of the choir. They are so large that they look like transept
arms. The tower is between choir and nave. The church front has a
narthex (wide porch) on its entire length. Plan by Marie Lebert.

200. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. The tower base and its Romanesque
gate. This walled-up gate is similar to the south gate of the church of
Saint-Loup. His semi-circular arch is formed by a grain surrounded by
an archivolt with a chamfered band. The grain is molded with a thick
angle torus followed by a listel and a shallow cavetto.  The grain
rests on two thick columns through a band  modled in quarter-round
forming the abacus of the capitals and going on along the bare wall.
The capital baskets are carved with a tree on the right and two human
heads on the left. The bases are square. The left base is topped with a
chamfer adorned with tiny triangular claws and a  torus. The right base
is topped by a double torus. The tympanum is formed by a large monolith
block of granite resting on inside abutments through a band molded in
quarter-round. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-110]

and the archidiachoné of Avranches. The church is under St. Pair's
patronage.

204. Sartilly. The Romanesque gate. The capital baskets are carved with
various designs like oak leaves, acanthus leaves, scrolls framing an
acanthus leaf at the corner, or corner curls. The sculptures, carved in
high relief in granite, are much more elegant than in any other small
church in the region. The square base of the columns is topped by a
double torus. Photo by Marie Lebert. [Marie-11]

205. Sartilly. The old Romanesque church, demolished in 1858, in a
drawing from  the journal Revue de l'Avranchin dated 1924-1926. This
church was described in the Minute Book of the City Council (Registre
des Délibérations du Conseil Municipal) of Sartilly of 1837-1864: "The
church we should replace is an old building (...) composed of: 1) a
dark nave which is 19 meters and 60 centimeters long and 7 meters wide,
with the lower part of its walls soaked with moisture and cracked in
several places, and not standing straight anymore, particularly towards
the end of the church; 2) a tower between the nave and the choir (...);
3) a choir which is 9 meters long and 6 meters wide (...)." Photo by

206. Sartilly. The Romanesque gate is in granite, which is the local
stone, Sartilly being located at the heart of the granite ground of
Vire. This gate, probably from the second half of the 12th century, is
the most beautiful Romanesque gate in the region. The moldings of the
arch and archivolt are the result of meticulous work, as well as the
sculptures of the capital baskets, with oak leaves, acanthus leaves and
scrolls. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-111]

large and slightly rounded bezants. The second grain is molded with a
thick angle torus. The third grain is molded with two tori surrounding
a listel. The archivolt is a prominent cordon ornated with saw-teeth in
