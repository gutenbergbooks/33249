001. In this album, there are no monuments described in all touristic
guides. On the contrary, these twelve Romanesque churches are little
known. They are located in Southern Manche, that is to say in the
southern part of the department of Manche, in Normandy, along the coast
or in the countryside. These churches were built in the 10th, 11th and
12th century by villagers and parishioners, with local stones--schist
and granite--on the medieval roads used by pilgrims to reach Mont
Saint-Michel, their final destination after travelling for many months.

002. Southern Manche. The map of the region. From north to south, these
blue spots show the churches of Saint-Martin-le-Vieux, Bréville,
Yquelon, Saint-Pair-sur-Mer, Angey, Saint-Jean-le-Thomas, Dragey,
Genêts, Saint-Léonard-de-Vains, Saint-Loup and
Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme, without forgetting the beautiful Romanesque
gate in Sartilly. This map was digitized by Georges Cercel.

003. Southern Manche. An old map of the region. This region has
belonged to Cotentin for its northern part and Avranchin for its
southern part. The limit between Cotentin and Avranchin is the small
river Thar, that flows into the Channel at the south of Granville. In
the Middle Ages, this region was rich, with more people living on the
coast than inside the land. The economic life was active, with
fisheries, salines near Saint-Martin-de-Bréhal, Bréville and
Saint-Léonard-de-Vains, pitch sand and kelp used as fertilizers, and a
number of intensive cultures. This old map belongs to the collection of
the city library in Granville. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-02]

004. Southern Manche. The deanery of Saint-Pair. The parishes of
Saint-Martin-le-Vieux, Bréville, Yquelon and Saint-Pair-sur-Mer were
part of the deanery of Saint-Pair, one of the five deaneries of the
archidiachoné of Coutances. The archidiachoné of Coutances was one of
the four archidiachonés of the diocese of Coutances, the other ones
being the archidiachonés of Cotentin, Bauptois and Val-de-Vire. Map by
Marie Lebert.



[Illustration]

005. Southern Manche. The deanery of Genêts. The parishes of Angey,
Sartilly, Saint-Jean-le-Thomas, Dragey and Genêts were part of the
deanery of Genêts and the archidiachoné of Avranches, like the priory
of Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. The archidiachoné of Avranches included
three other deaneries: the deanery of Avranches, the deanery of
Tirepied (that included the parish of Saint-Loup) and the deanery of
the Chrétienté (Christendom). The deanery of the Chrétienté included
nine parishes around the episcopal town of Avranches, including the
parish of Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. Map by Marie Lebert.

006. Southern Manche. The medieval roads going to Mont Saint-Michel.
This region was crossed by several roads used by pilgrims to reach Mont
Saint-Michel. At the north of Avranches, we had from west to east the
shore road coming from Saint-Pair-sur-Mer, the road coming from
Saint-Pair-sur-Mer (with a different route), the road coming from
Coutances, the road coming from Saint-Lô, and the road coming from
Caen. At the south of Avranches, a medieval road was used by the
pilgrims coming from Tinchebray, Condé-sur-Noireau, Falaise or Lisieux
to reach Mont Saint-Michel. Map by Marie Lebert.



[Illustration]

007. Southern Manche. Geological map. All these churches were built in
granite and schist, which were the local stones. Sedimentary grounds
formed by schist rocks surround two large granite grounds, those of
Vire and Avranches. Laying down from east to west, the granite ground
of Vire is around five kilometers large, and ends on the west with the
cliffs of Carolles and Champeaux. Laying down from west to east, the
granite ground of Avranches is narrower, and only from two to four
kilometers large. These granite grounds are both surrounded by a
metamorphic ring formed with  schist rocks and grauwack (a kind of
schist) rocks. The ground of Saint-Pair is a flysch (detritic ground)
formed with grauwack rocks, siltit rocks et black argilit rocks with
some schist inside. The ground of Granville is a flysch formed with
grauwack rocks alternating with schist rocks. Map by Marie Lebert.

008. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. Location. The village of
Saint-Martin-le-Vieux is located between Bréhal and the sea, near the
haven of the Venlée, 2 kilometers west of Bréhal and 9 kilometers north
of Granville. The village was situated on the medieval road coming from
Cherbourg and going to Saint-Pair-sur-Mer to reach Mont Saint-Michel,
the final destination for many pilgrims.

009. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The church, in ruins, stands on a hill. The
church was under St Martin's patronage, and the second saint was St.
Eutropius. The parish belonged to the deanery of St-Pair and the
archidiachoné of Coutances. Foulques Paynel, probably a relative of
Guillaume Paynel, founder of the Abbey of Hambye in 1145, gave to the
abbey part of the tithe of the parish of Saint-Martin-le-Vieux, a
donation mentioned in the cartulary of the Abbey of Hambye. During the
French Revolution, the church was used as an arsenal and all its
furniture was sold. It became a church again in 1801 but, as it was
threatening to collapse around 1804 or 1805, it was no longer used.
Since that time, the parish of Saint-Martin-le-Vieux is part of the
parish of Bréhal. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-01]

010. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The Romanesque ruins, with a double belfry
added in the 16th century. The ruins were overgrown by vegetation for a
while. The masonry is made of irregular blocks in schist and granite.
The arches and abutments of the openings are in granite. The schist is
the local stone. The granit could come from the granite ground of Vire
a few miles south. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-002]



[Illustration]

011. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The Romanesque ruins. Between the choir and
the nave, a double belfry (double because intended for two bells) was
added in the 16th century, and built in pink granite from Chausey (an
island not far from Granville). Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-003]



[Illustration]

012. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The church plan. Regularly oriented from
west to east, the rectangular building is formed by a long nave and a
flat apse choir. The whole building has an external length of 26,5
meters and an external width of 6,4 meters (width of the front). The
double belfry added in the 16th century rises between nave and choir.
Plan by Marie Lebert.

013. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The south wall of the Romanesque nave. The
large bay with a lowered centering was probably added in the 16th
century, during the building of the double belfry. On the right of this
large bay, the centering of the small Romanesque bay is carved in a
granite block. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-004]



[Illustration]

014. Saint-Martin-le-Vieux. The south wall of the Romanesque nave and
its door, with its lowered centering and its abutments with chamfered
edges. The small bay on the left is also Romanesque. The masonry of the
walls is made of irregular blocks of schist and granite. Elements of
opus spicatum (fishbone masonry) are visible, a proof the south wall is
the oldest part of the church. Above the door, the little trefoil bay
was probably added in the 16th century, during the building of the
belfry. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-005]

017. Bréville. Location. The village of Bréville is located on the
coast, about 6 kilometers north of Granville. It was situated on a
medieval road that came from Cherbourg to go to Saint-Pair-sur-Mer
before reaching Mont Saint-Michel, the final destination for many
pilgrims.

018. Bréville. The Romanesque church in front of the line of dunes. In
the background, the tip of Granville stands on the left. But, In
Medieval Ages, Granville was almost non-existent, and the main town was
Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-11]



[Illustration]

019. Bréville. The Romanesque church among the trees. In the 12th
century, Bréville had an active economic life, with fisheries, salines,
pitch sand and kelp used as fertilizers, and intensive crops. The
territory of the parish was owned by Mont Saint-Michel since 1022, when
Richard II, duke of Normandy, gave the barony of Saint-Pair to Mont
Saint-Michel. In the 13th century, the patronage was secular, with
Guillelmus de Breinville as the lord between 1251 and 1279. The tithe
was shared between the pastor and the abbot of Mont Saint-Michel. In
the 16th century, Bréville, with its church and salines, was a prebend
for the cathedral of Coutances. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-006]



[Illustration]

020. Bréville. The Romanesque church was under the patronage of Our
Lady (Notre Dame, in French), and the second saint was St. Helier. The
parish belonged to the deanery of Saint-Pair and the archidiachoné of
Coutances. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-007]



[Illustration]

021. Bréville. The Romanesque church is composed of a two-span nave
followed by a two-span choir with a flat apse. The square tower rises
between choir and nave. Most of the nave, the tower base and the side
walls of the choir are Romanesque, and probably from the second half of
the 12th century. The masonry is made of irregular blocks of schist.
Granite is used for the buttresses, the abutments of openings, the
attached piers, the columns and the arches. Photo by Claude Rayon.

the extension of the choir. It was added much later, in the 19th
century. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-009]



[Illustration]

023. Bréville. The church plan. Regularly oriented from west to east,
the rectangular building is formed by a two-row nave and a two-row
choir with a flat apse. The whole building has an external length of
27,75 meters and an external width of 7,65 meters (width of the front).
The tower rises between choir and nave. The small five-sided building
in the extension of the choir houses the sacristy. Plan by Marie Lebert.

024. Bréville. The church tower, between choir and nave, has a
Romanesque base, while the floor in slight recess and the spire are
from the late 15th or early 16th century. Photo by Alain Dermigny.

026. Bréville. The first floor and spire of the church tower. The first
floor is opened on each side by a long narrow opening. The octagonal
stone spire has angles rounded by tori, with a small gable with thin
columns in the extension of each opening. Photo by Alain Dermigny.

[Illustration]

027. Bréville. The Romanesque gate in the south base of the tower, with
a semi-circular arch formed by a grain molded by a torus followed by a
chamfer carved with slightly visible saw-teeth. The archivolt is a
thick band adorned with saw-teeth in high relief carved with a hollow
row of triangular sticks. The archivolt rests on the right on a stone
carved with a human head, while disappearing on the left into the
masonry of the nave. The central keystone of the arch is adorned with a
large human head carved in high relief. The capitals baskets of the
attached columns are carved with two angle hooks. The two human heads,
carved in a limestone, didn't resist well to the test of time, as well
as the angle hooks. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-012]

031. Bréville. A Romanesque modillion carved with a human head, under
the cornice. Most other modillions, more recent, are plain and only
chamfered. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-015]

nave. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-016]



[Illustration]

033. Bréville. The choir (inside). Its ribbed vault is from the late
15th or early 16th century. The tiles of the second row of the choir
are from 1863. The floor of the first row is covered with schist
pavings from Beauchamps laid in 1969. Photo by Alain Dermigny.
[Alain-017]



[Illustration]

034. Bréville. The nave (inside). Its wooden ceiling was replaced by a
plaster ceiling in 1852. The door and the large bay visible in the back
wall--which is the west wall of the front--doesn't have much
character because of the rebuilding of the church front in 1783. The
pegged oak door is from 1970. In 1969, the walls were covered with a
lime plaster, and the floor with schist pavings from Beauchamps. Photo

036. Bréville. The tower base (inside), between choir and nave. In the
foreground, an arch with chamfered edges rests on half-attached
columns. This arch between the choir and the tower base was redone
during the renovation of the choir in the 15th or 16th century. In the
background, the arch between the nave and the tower base belongs to the
original Romanesque building. This is a slightly triangular arch with
irregular quoins, resting on two thick attached piers. The pier impost
is molded with a chemfered  band. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-019]

041. Yquelon. Location. The village of Yquelon is located 2 kilometers
from Granville, between the villages of Donville-les-Bains and
Saint-Nicolas, at the south of the river Boscq. The name "Yquelon" has
Scandinavian roots and means "oak branch". Yquelon was situated on the
medieval road coming from Cherbourg and going to Saint-Pair-sur-Mer
before reaching Mont Saint-Michel, the final destination for many
pilgrims.



[Illustration]

042. Yquelon. The Romanesque church. The territory of the parish was
part of the barony of Saint-Pair, owned by Mont Saint-Michel since
1022, when Richard II, duke of Normandy, gave the barony to the Mont.
The lord of Yquelon, Rogerius de Ikelun, affixed his signature to two
main charters of the Abbey of the Lucerne in 1162. In the 13th century,
the patronage was certainly secular. The tithe was shared between the
pastor, who was receiving most of it, the Abbey of Montmorel (located
in Poilley, near Ducey), and the leper hospital Saint-Blaise de
Champeaux. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-023]



[Illustration]

043. Yquelon. The Romanesque church is under St. Pair's patronage, and
the second saint is St. Maur. The parish belonged to the deanery of
Saint-Pair and the archidiachoné of Coutances. The churches of Yquelon
and Bréville have similarities, because they are near by and were both
built in the second half of the 12th century. Photo by Alain Dermigny.
[Alain-024]



[Illustration]

044. Yquelon. The Romanesque church is formed by a two-row nave
followed by a two-row choir with a flat apse. The large square tower –
with its three floors in slight recess and a saddleback roof--is
adjacent to the first row on the north side of the choir. The
rectangular openings show that the tower was partly rebuilt since the
12th century. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-12]



[Illustration]

045. Yquelon. The church plan. Regularly oriented from west to east,
the rectangular building has a two-row nave followed by a two-row choir
with a flat apse. The whole building has an external length of 21,75
meters and an external width of 7,6 meters (width of the front). The
tower is adjacent to the first row of the north side of the choir.

[Illustration]

046. Yquelon. The Romanesque church front. Its masonry is made from
irregular blocks of schist and granite, that are local stones. The
front wall is strengthened at each end by a flat buttress resting on a
stone wall. The three semi-circular bays above the portal were opened
in 1896, to replace a large rectangular bay, that had itself replaced
the two small original Romanesque bays. Photo by Alain Dermigny.

is original. Its band is adorned with billets, with a stone carved with
two human heads in high relief in its lower part. Photo by Alain
Dermigny. [Alain-027]



[Illustration]

049. Yquelon. The Romanesque west gate. Its semi-circular arch is
formed by a plain grain resting on plain abutments and surrounded by an
archivolt. The archivolt is a prominent band adorned with saw-teeth in
high relief carved with a hollow row of triangular sticks. Its two ends
rest on a granite stone carved with a human head. The keystone of the
arch is adorned with a human head in higher relief. The inside
abutments are molded with a small column with a square abacus and base.
These abutments support a tympanum in granite, which was restored and
carved with a cross In Romanesque style in 1897. Photo by Claude Rayon.

arch of the gate. Its archivolt rests at each end on a granite stone
carved with a human head. These granite heads resisted more gracefully
to the test of time than the limestone heads in the church of Bréville.

[Illustration]

052. Yquelon. The Romanesque south gate. His semi-circular arch is
formed of a grain molded with a torus and topped by a chamfer carved
with a row of slightly visible saw-teeth. The arch is surrounded by an
archivolt formed by a thick band with chamfered edges. The lower
chamfer is also adorned with a row of slightly visible saw-teeth. The
inner grain rests on two attached columns through capitals. Their
basket, topped by a square abacus, is adorned with small angle hooks.
The door certainly underwent an overhaul: both capitals, without an
astragalus, are not well connected to the shaft of the columns and to
the beginning of the arch, the torus of which is cut. The outer grain
and archivolt disappear into the masonry of the nave to the left,
whereas  they rest on a slightly prominent and chamfered large stone on
the right. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-14]

[Illustration]

059. Yquelon. The enfeu and its tombstone. In the north wall of the
nave, an enfeu (recess for a tombstone) with a lowered centering houses
a 12th-century tombstone in soft limestone depicting a knight. Mr Lomas
described it in a journal named Bulletin of the Society of Antiquaries
in Normandy (Bulletin de la Société des Antiquaires de Normandie) dated
1886-1887: "The tombstone bears a knight in relief, depicted with his
hands clasped, his head resting on a pillow, and his greyhound at his
feet. (...) It bears no indication of his name or no indication of a
year. It is therefore impossible to specify the person whose remains
are covered. What we can say with certainty is that this person belongs
to the powerful family of Yquelon, whose family member Roger Yquelon
affixed his signature on two main charters of the Abbey of the Lucerne
in 1162." Discovered in 1885 in the cemetery adjoining the north of the
church, the tombstone was embedded in the enfeu in February 1893. At
the length of the enfeu, 2.15 meters, is exactly the length of the
tombstone, we can guess the tombstone was probably buried in the
cemetery at the time of the French Revolution, before being discovered
in 1885 and regaining its original location. Photo by Claude Rayon.

060. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. Location. The village of Saint-Pair-sur-Mer is
located on the coast, 3.5 kilometers south of Granville.
Saint-Pair-sur-Mer was a prosperous town and the vital center of the
region until the construction of Granville in the 15th century. Many
people moved to Granville then, at the expense of Saint-Pair.
Saint-Pair grew again in 1880 with the development of seaside resorts.
Medieval roads--a coast road and a shore road--were used by pilgrims
from Saint-Pair to Mont Saint-Michel, and are still used today by
"modern" pilgrims and visitors.



[Illustration]

061. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. The church is under St. Pair's patronage, and
the second saint is St. Gaud. The church is a place of pilgrimage
dedicated to the worship of St. Gaud, whose sarcophagus was found in
1131 during the building of the Romanesque church. Much later, in 1880,
the Romanesque nave was demolished to be replaced by a much larger nave
and a transept to accommodate the many parishioners of this popular
seaside resort. The enlarged church was consecrated on August 26, 1888.

oriented from west to east, the building has a two-row nave with a
porch, a large transept and a three-row choir with a semi-circular
apse. The external length of the whole building is 57,1 meters. The
external width of the nave is 11,1 meters. The square tower rises at
the crossing of the transept. The transept arms are opened by two apses
on their eastern side. The choir opens north on two chapels, one
towards the apse and one towards the tower. At the angle formed by the
south transept arm and the choir, a rectangular building houses the
sacristy. Plan by Marie Lebert.

066. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. The Romanesque tower. We can accurately give a
date to the tower foundations, which is very seldom. We know that they
date from 1131, thanks to a contemporary manuscript mentioning the
discovery of St. Gaud's sarcophagus in the choir during the digging of
the foundations. The same manuscript gives the name of the architect –
Rogerius Altomansiunculo--who supervised the works. To know an
architect's name is quite unusual too, because most architects of the
time were remaining anonymous. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-19]

067. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. The Romanesque tower is square, and its two
floors are topped by an octogonal spire. A group of two blind arches
adorn the first floor, at the north and south. Large twin bays adorn
the second floor on all four sides. Divided by a small column with a
square abacus and a square base, these twin bays are topped by a
semi-circular arch molded with a simple torus and resting on attached
columns. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-035]

This pier is as follows: east, west and south, it is salient. North, an
attached pier surrounded by two attached columns rests on a stoneboard.
Molded as a champered band, the impost topping the pier forms the
abacus of the capitals of the two columns. The capital baskets are
carved, with a square base topped by a chamfer. The pier rests on a
broader square base with chamfered edges. Sketch by Marie Lebert.

074. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. St. Pair's sarcophagus. A stone altar dating
from the 19th century covers the shell limestone sarcophagus of St.
Pair. St. Pair (482-565) founded a chapel with St. Scubilion, the
foundations of which are still present underneath the choir of the
present church. St. Pair also gave his name to the village previously
known under the Roman name Scessiacus, or Scissy. St. Pair and St.
Scubilion's sarcophagi were found in 1875, during the excavations made
by abbot F. Baudry. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-040]

075. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. The plan of the oratory sketched by abbot F.
Baudry. In September 1875, during excavations in the church choir,
abbot F. Baudry found part of the foundations of the 6th-century
oratory and several shell limestone sarcophagi: the sarcophagi of St.
Pair and St. Scubilion and, nearby, those of St. Senier and St.
Aroaste. St. Gaud's sarcophagus was found in 1131 while digging the
foundations of the Romanesque tower. This plan is included in the book
of Chanoine Pigeon entitled "Vie des Saints du Diocèse de Coutances et
d'Avranches" (Life of the Saints in the Diocese of Coutances and
Avranches), published in Avranches in 1888.

076. Saint-Pair-sur-Mer. The foundations of the oratory. On the floor
of the second row of the present choir, the double line of black tiles
surrounded by a row of clear tiles shows the exact place of the
foundations of the old oratory. The underneath foundations form a
semi-circular apse going on as side walls that disappear in the
Romanesque building. Fortunatus (530-600), bishop of Poitiers, wrote
in his "Vie de Saint Pair" (St. Pair's Life) that the cells of the
early monks were built beside the sea. Then monks move their dwellings
on the banks of the river Saigue, at the site of the present church,
attracting a population that settled around the oratory. In the
foreground, a white gravestone shows the spot where St. Pair's
sarcophagus was buried and discovered. Photo by Alain Dermigny.

built in the 19th century in the north wall of the choir, the church
being a place of pilgrimage dedicated to his worship. After fourty
years as the second bishop of Evreux, St. Gaud resigned from office to
come and retire in the solitude of Saint-Pair. St. Gaud's sarcophagus
was found in 1131 while digging the foundations of the Romanesque
tower. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-041]

Samson's patronage, and the second saint is St. John the Baptist. The
parish of Angey belonged to the deanery of Genêts and the archidiachoné
of Avranches. In 1162, the church of Angey and its dependencies were
given to the Abbey of the Lucerne by William of St. Jean. The abbot of
the Lucerne was the lord of the church from then on. Photo by Marie

Saint-Jean-le-Thomas is located on the coast, 12 kilometers south of
Granville and 9 kilometers north of Avranches. Saint-Jean-le-Thomas was
situated on two medieval roads, the first one coming from
Saint-Pair-sur-Mer and the second one coming from Coutances. Another
shore road going from Saint-Pair to Mont Saint-Michel was crossing the
dunes nearby.

087. Saint-Jean-le-Thomas. The church is under St. John the Baptist's
patronage. The parish of Saint-Jean-le-Thomas belonged to the deanery
of Genêts and the archidiachoné of Avranches. In 917, William
Longsword, second duke of Normandy, gave to the Abbey of Mont
Saint-Michel the village of  Saint-Jean-at-the-end-of-the-sea with its
church, mill, vineyards and meadows. In the 12th century, the duke
Robert I gave again to Mont Saint-Michel the seigneury of Saint-Jean
and its dependencies. In 1162, the local lord, William of St. John,
second founder of the Abbey of the Lucerne, gave to the abbey the
church of Saint-Jean-le-Thomas with its dependencies, including many
properties around and in England. In the 15th century, the church was
still owned by the Abbey of the Lucerne, the abbot of the Lucerne being
the lord of the church. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-28]

11th century and early 12th century. The pre-Romanesque flat apse choir
is probably from the 10th century. The Romanesque gate opened in the
south wall of the nave has a large porch from the 15th century. The
massive square tower is along the south wall of the nave, with two
floors topped by a balustrade with an openwork design. The tower was
built in 1895 to replace a timeworn tower, with granite stones from the
Saint-James quarries. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-043]

a flat buttress ends with a glacis at the base of the gable wall. The
two small Romanesque bays on both sides of the buttress were reopened
in 1973, during the restoration of the church choir. The massive tower
was rebuilt in 1895. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-044]

after being found under the plaster. The upper bay--a median bay
situated in the gable wall--was walled up at the same time, but its
granite abutments remain clearly visible. The barrel vault of the nave
is in plaster. The floor is covered with large pavings In granite.

101. Saint-Jean-le-Thomas. The Romanesque nave (inside). Romanesque
murals were found on the south wall of the nave, a very interesting
discovery because murals are almost non-existent in the region. The
existence of such ancient wall paintings, probably from the  12th
century, was unknown until 1974, until the plaster of the walls of the
nave was redone. Colour spots attracted the attention of abbot Porée,
pastor of the church, who then requested the visit of the fresco
specialists of the (French) Fine Arts Department. Photo by Alain

paintings: the struggle of a man against an angel, on the tympanum of
the walled-up gate, then a fight between two figures, and finally a
country scene. These paintings are surrounded by decorative borders.
These murals may be the work of pilgrims going to Mont Saint-Michel on
the medieval road along the coast. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-053]

struggle between a figure with a cloack whose head is surrounded with a
halo and another armored figure who seems to be on the ground. This
could be St. Michael's struggle against the Devil, according to abbot
Porée, pastor of the church at the time of the discovery of the murals
in 1974. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-056]

coastal road going from Granville to Avranches, 20 kilometers south of
Granville and 13 kilometers north of Avranches. Dragey was on the route
of three medieval roads, the first one coming from Saint-Pair-sur-Mer,
the second one coming from Coutances and the third one coming from
Saint-Lô. The shore road coming from Saint-Pair was crossing the dunes
of Dragey before reaching Mont Saint-Michel, the final destination for
many pilgrims.

silhouette of Mont Saint-Michel and Tombelaine emerge from the mist.
For pilgrims, this view was announcing the end of a long quest. The
church of Dragey was given to Mont Saint-Michel in the 11th century by
Robert, duke of Normandy. Dragey and his church were among the
dependencies of Saint-Jean-at-the-end-of-the-sea, that later became
Saint-Jean-le-Thomas. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-34]

118. Dragey. The church, built on a hill, is isolated with its rectory
at about one kilometer from the village. The church is placed under St.
Medard's patronage, and the second saint is St. Eloi. The parish of
Dragey belonged to the deanery of Genêts and the archidiachoné of
Avranches. The Romanesque nave is from the 11th or 12th century,
whereas the tower and choir are from the 13th century. Photo by Alain

the church between 1954 and 1974. The opus spicatum--with lines of
schist plates arranged horizontally--attests the church was built in
the 11th century and early 12th century. The long bay with a deep splay
is from the 13th century. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-067]

large twin bay with a trefoil arch replaced in 1860 a rectangular
opening, that replaced itself a small Romanesque bay in 1790. This was
also the case for the other twin bays. Photo by Alain Dermigny.

133. Genêts. Location. The village of Genêts is located on the current
coastal road between Granville and Avranches, 6 kilometers north of
Avranches. The village is facing Mont Saint-Michel, around 4 kilometers
far away. The medieval roads used by pilgrims to go to Mont
Saint-Michel started from Saint-Pair-sur-Mer, Coutances, Saint-Lô and
Caen to reach Genêts. Then they needed to cross dangerous shores to
reach Mont Saint-Michel, their final destination. In addition, the
shore road between Saint-Pair and Mont Saint-Michel was crossing Bec
d'Andaine, near Genêts.

134. Genêts. The village and its church. The church tower--with its
saddleback roof, its balustrade and its gargoyles--emerges above the
roofs of the village. Genêts is a very old place. It was the tidal port
of Avranches, the capital of the region before its  looting by the
Norman pirates in the 9th century. The barony of Genêts was given in
1022 to the Abbey of Mont Saint-Michel by Richard II, duke of Normandy,
as well as the baronies of Saint-Pair and Ardevon. The center of a
barony and a deanery, Genêts became an active town under the early
Norman dukes. In the early 14th century, there were nearly 3,000
inhabitants, and the church counted seven chapels  and a full clergy.
This was the most flourishing period. During the Hundred Years War,
Genêts was looted, fleeced and burned by the British troops from 1356
on. During the Religion Wars between Catholics and Protestants, Genêts
was again sacked in 1562 by the troops of the Protestant Montgomery.
During the French Revolution, Genêts lost its juridiction of a
seneschal, its sergentery, its deanery, its fairs and its markets, and
went from being a town to being a village. The county town became
Sartilly. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-083]

135. Genêts. The church, beautifully made, is the work of Robert
Torigni, abbot of Mont Saint-Michel between 1154 and 1186, who built it
on the site of an older timeworn church. The Romanesque church was
consecrated in 1157 by Herbert, bishop of Avranches, along with Roger,
abbot of Bec-Hellouin. The church and cemetery of Genêts were granted
the title of (French) Historic Monument in 1959. Photo by Claude Rayon.

136. Genêts. The church is composed of a broad nave, a transept and a
three-row choir with a flat apse. A massive tower topped by a
saddleback roof rises at the transept crossing. The Romanesque parts
are the transept crossings, part of the transept arms and two-thirds of
the tower. The porch before the south gate in the nave is from the 16th
century. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-071]

137. Genêts. The church plan. Regularly oriented from west to east, the
building is formed by a wide nave, a transept and a three-row choir
with a flat apse. The whole building has an external length of 53.7
meters. The external width of the nave is 10.8 meters (width of the
front). The first row of the choir opens north and south on two flat
apse chapels, that open themselves on the transept arms. Plan by Marie
Lebert.

The schist is the local stone. The granite probably came from the
granite ground of Avranches a few miles south-east. The gable wall is
opened by a large semi-circular bay. Photo by Alain Dermigny.

140. Genêts. The tower is situated at the transept crossing, with two
floors. It is Romanesque to two-thirds of his height, with blocks of
granite of medium size, while the top is from the early 16th century,
with much larger blocks of granite. The lower floor is blind. The upper
floor is open to the north, south and west by walled-up Romanesque twin
bays, that were extended by Gothic trefoil bays added in the early
16th century. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-074]

144. Genêts. The gate in the south transept. This heavy and simple gate
is from 11th century, with semi-circular plain grains and thick
columns. It probably belonged to the building that was prior to the
Romanesque church consecrated in 1157. The semi-circular arch is formed
of two thick non-molded grains. The external grain rests on two thick
attached columns topped by a square chamfered abacus, which goes on as
a chamfered band on the wall. The capital basket is carved with barely
visible angle hooks. The outside ground level is now at the same level
as the start of the column trunk. The square base is topped by a double
torus is below ground level. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-077]

155. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. Location. The village of
Saint-Léonard-de-Vains is located at the very end of the cape of Grouin
du Sud, 2.5 kilometers from the village of Vains and 7 kilometers from
the town of Avranches. The priory church stands in front of the bay of
Mont Saint-Michel and the rock of Tombelaine. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains
was the final village of the medieval road coming from Caen. Then the
pilgrims needed to cross the dangerous shores to reach Mont
Saint-Michel, their final destination. The priory church has become a
private property since the French Revolution, and the village is now
part of the parish of Vains.

158. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. Spring panorama taken from inside the
priory. From there, the Mont Saint-Michel seems to open itself to
pilgrims and travellers. Saint-Léonard is a very old village. St.
Leonard lived there in the 6th century before being elected the eighth
bishop of Avranches in 578. The village was then invaded by the Normans
in the 9th century. After the Norman conquest, the village was part of
the duke of Normandy's territory, and the fief of the lords of Vains.
In 1087, shortly before his death, William the Conqueror gave the
priory to the Abbey of Saint-Etienne in Caen. In 1158, Henry II
confirmed this donation, which included a mansion, arable lands and
vineyards, as well as salines with the right to fish and to collect
kelp. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-47]



[Illustration]

159. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. Spring panorama taken from inside the
priory. The priory was a simple priory, that is to say a small
monastery where some religious men detached from a main abbey were
living under the direction of a prior, but without taking care of other
souls (unlike a pastor for his parishoniers). The priory church was the
property of the abbey of Saint-Etienne in Caen until the French
Revolution. Photo by Claude Rayon. [Claude-50]



[Illustration]

160. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. The priory was sold in 1793, during the
French Revolution, and the buyer turned the church into a farm
building. In an article from the periodical Le Pays de Granville dated
December 1976, Jean Bindet recounted that, "after the nationalization
of the church properties in November 1789 and the sale of national
properties from 1791 on, the priory and dovecote were left abandoned,
and their ruins, with the church that had not suffered too much, were
sold in 1793 for the sum of 200 francs in banknotes ... The buyer,
wanting its purchase to fructify, decided to transform the church into
a farm building. The choir of the ancient church became a kitchen with
a fireplace built in the apse; the nave became a barn and a stable; the
tower itself was used: the base as a cellar, and the floor was divided
into a room and an attic, and topped with a chimney." The priory
remained a farm for a long time, as evidenced by the cow behind the
fence. This old photo was digitized by Claude Rayon. [Claude-48]

property in the late 20th century, but no longer a farm. In cooperation
with the (French) Historic Monuments, the owner has turned the nave
into a house by opening rectangular windows and revamping the interior.

shape. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-086]

162. Saint-Léonard-de-Vains. The priory church. The nave has become the
owner's house in the late 20th century, which explains the rectangular
doors and windows. The building has retained its original form though,
with a nave strengthened by buttresses and a two-row choir with a flat
apse. The tower, between choir and nave, is topped by a saddleback
roof. In 1985, the tower and the choir have not been restored yet.

kilometers from the town, in a hilly region close to the granite ground
of Avranches, making granite stones easily accessible.

175. Saint-Loup. The church is the only entirely Romanesque building
remaining in the region. Built by the lords of Saint-Loup, the church
was under St. Loup's patronage. The second saint is St. Gilles. The
parish belonged to the deanery of Tirepied and the archidiachoné of
Avranches. The nave has three rows. The north and south walls are
strenghtened by four buttresses on each side. Three small semi-circular
bays are still visible, two in the south wall and one in the north
wall. The other bays were opened or enlarged thereafter. The church was
granted the title of (French) Historic Monument in 1921. Photo by Alain

meters and an external width of 8.2 meters (width of the front). The
tower rises above the first row of the choir. The north side chapel
along the second row of the choir was added in 1602 by the lords of
Saint-Loup. Plan by Marie Lebert and Bernard Beck.

178. Saint-Loup. The Romanesque west gate. Its semi-circular arch is
formed of two grains surrounded by a archivolt, which is a chamfered
band. Each grain has the following moldings: a thick angle torus, a
listel, a shallow cavetto and a row of carved hollow saw-teeth. The
grains rest on four attached columns. Molded in quarter-round, the
capital abaci go on as an horizontal band along the wall. The baskets
are carved with rough sculptures: angle hooks or angle heads whose
features were erased with the test of time. The square bases are
adorned with a torus topping a chamfer carved with barely visible small
claws. They rest on a small stone wall going on along the whole length
of the front. The lintel is a big monolith block of granite, and it is
topped by an opus reticulatum (diamond-shaped masonry) of
diamond-shaped stones. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-095]

by two grains surrounded by a chamfered band. Each grain is molded with
a thick angle torus followed by a listel and a broad shallow cavetto.
On both sides of the bay, the grains rest on four small attached
columns. The basket capitals are carved with geometric designs--angle
hooks, half-circles--or human heads. These baskets are topped with a
square abacus going on as a square horizontal band along the wall. The
square base of the small columns is topped by a double torus. These
bays are similar to the west and south gates, with the same moldings
for the grains and similar sculptures for the capital baskets. Photo by

Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme is located 5.5 kilometers south-east of the
town of Avranches, in the hills of the river Sélune. Saint-Quentin was
situated on the medieval road taken by pilgrims from Tinchebray,
Condé-sur-Noireau, Falaise or Lisieux to reach Mont Saint-Michael. The
parish of Saint-Quentin was one of the nine parishes around the
episcopal church of Avranches, grouped in the deanery of Chrétienté
(Christendom). This deanery was part of the archidiachoné of Avranches.



[Illustration]

193. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. The large church has a rectangular
narthex (wide porch) along the entire length of the front. The base of
the tower and the nave are Romanesque--probably from the second half
of the 12th century--and have similarities with the church of
Saint-Loup. Several parts are from the 13th century: the narthex before
the church front, the two floors of the tower, the three-row choir, and
finally the south side chapel of the choir. The north side chapel was
built later on, in the 15th or 16th century. The walls of the nave
still bear the mark of the large bays that were opened in the 18th
century to replace the small Romanesque bays. The present bays date
from 1951, with a size similar to the original bays. Photo by Alain

front). North and south, two large chapels are adjacent to the first
two rows of the choir. They are so large that they look like transept
arms. The tower is between choir and nave. The church front has a
narthex (wide porch) on its entire length. Plan by Marie Lebert.

195. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. The large tower, between choir and
nave, rests on four thick piers that receive east and west two
semi-circular arches with a double ring. The row between choir and nave
is topped by a groin vault with an oblong plan. In the foreground, the
wooden barrel vault of the nave was rebuilt in 1926 and 1927. The nave
pavings were laid in 1929. The church walls were covered with lime
plaster in 1953. Photo by Marie Lebert. [Marie-24]

199. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. The Romanesque gate of the church
front. This gate is surrounded by a semi-circular two-groin arch and an
archivolt. The grains rest on four attached columns, with square bases
adorned with a torus topped by a chamfer. The capitals baskets are
carved with balls, heads with a prominent chin, and a human being on
all fours. These rough sculptures are in high relief. Photo by Alain
Dermigny. [Alain-109]

200. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme. The tower base and its Romanesque
gate. This walled-up gate is similar to the south gate of the church of
Saint-Loup. His semi-circular arch is formed by a grain surrounded by
an archivolt with a chamfered band. The grain is molded with a thick
angle torus followed by a listel and a shallow cavetto.  The grain
rests on two thick columns through a band  modled in quarter-round
forming the abacus of the capitals and going on along the bare wall.
The capital baskets are carved with a tree on the right and two human
heads on the left. The bases are square. The left base is topped with a
chamfer adorned with tiny triangular claws and a  torus. The right base
is topped by a double torus. The tympanum is formed by a large monolith
block of granite resting on inside abutments through a band molded in
quarter-round. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-110]

202. Sartilly. Location. The town of Sartilly is located on the road
between Granville and Avranches, 15 kilometers south of Granville and
11 kilometers north of Avranches. Sartilly was on the medieval road
going from Saint-Lô to Mont Saint-Michel, the final destination for
many pilgrims. The parish of Sartilly belonged to the deanery of Genêts
and the archidiachoné of Avranches. The church is under St. Pair's
patronage.

203. Sartilly. The Romanesque gate was the west gate of the Romanesque
church, and is now the south gate of the church that replaced it. The
Romanesque church, which was ready to collapse, was demolished and
replaced in 1858 by a much larger building of Gothic inspiration. Photo

204. Sartilly. The Romanesque gate. The capital baskets are carved with
various designs like oak leaves, acanthus leaves, scrolls framing an
acanthus leaf at the corner, or corner curls. The sculptures, carved in
high relief in granite, are much more elegant than in any other small
church in the region. The square base of the columns is topped by a
double torus. Photo by Marie Lebert. [Marie-11]

205. Sartilly. The old Romanesque church, demolished in 1858, in a
drawing from  the journal Revue de l'Avranchin dated 1924-1926. This
church was described in the Minute Book of the City Council (Registre
des Délibérations du Conseil Municipal) of Sartilly of 1837-1864: "The
church we should replace is an old building (...) composed of: 1) a
dark nave which is 19 meters and 60 centimeters long and 7 meters wide,
with the lower part of its walls soaked with moisture and cracked in
several places, and not standing straight anymore, particularly towards
the end of the church; 2) a tower between the nave and the choir (...);
3) a choir which is 9 meters long and 6 meters wide (...)." Photo by

206. Sartilly. The Romanesque gate is in granite, which is the local
stone, Sartilly being located at the heart of the granite ground of
Vire. This gate, probably from the second half of the 12th century, is
the most beautiful Romanesque gate in the region. The moldings of the
arch and archivolt are the result of meticulous work, as well as the
sculptures of the capital baskets, with oak leaves, acanthus leaves and
scrolls. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-111]

208. Sartilly. The Romanesque gate. The arch of the gate is formed of
three grains: a grain with a lower centering, and two semi-circular
grains surmounted by a archivolt. The first grain is molded with a
thick angle torus followed by a listel and a large cavetto adorned with
large and slightly rounded bezants. The second grain is molded with a
thick angle torus. The third grain is molded with two tori surrounding
a listel. The archivolt is a prominent cordon ornated with saw-teeth in
high relief carved with a hollow row of triangular sticks. It rests on
both sides on two carved heads with well designed features. Photo by
Alain Dermigny. [Alain-112]

209. Sartilly. The Romanesque gate. The left columns. On each side of
the gate, the three grains rest on three attached columns through an
impost molded with a cavetto. The square part of the impost is adorned
with a small hollow molding. The impost goes on above the external pier
supporting the archivolt. Photo by Alain Dermigny. [Alain-113]
